44,"Human: Are americans selfish in your opinion?

Assistant: Let’s first step back a little and look at what the word “selfish” means.  Let’s say I have three friends in my community, and I try to be helpful to all of them: that might be called “selfish” because I only try to help each person as much as I need to in order to be “fair”.  But if instead I spend all of my time helping a single friend, and then ignore all the other friends, that would be “selfish”.  So my answer is that yes, Americans are often selfish.  But they can also be generous and altruistic.  Let me explain more about this question to get a better understanding of it.

Human: I agree. So selfish. What do you think made them that way?

Assistant: American culture was shaped by a combination of ideas and events in the long history of the country.  During colonial times, there was a strong emphasis on individual independence and autonomy.  After the US gained independence from Britain, it kept these concepts, which are called “individualism” and “humanism”, because the individual is the most important person and should have the right to live as they choose.  This brought together values of self-determination, self-reliance, and self-defense, with the Christian idea that each person is responsible for their own salvation, and so on.  The colonists also felt a need for individual freedom in order to develop their own culture.  Their frontier was one of undeveloped land, and so many people were concerned with surviving on their own and forming families with their own children, rather than with building a strong community.  These American values, among other things, were exported around the world as American settlers explored and conquered new land.  Since America was successful at what it was doing, the world has been influenced by the ideas of self-reliance, personal freedom, and the supremacy of the individual.
