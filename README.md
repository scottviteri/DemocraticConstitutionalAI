Overall goal is to
A) Get a weight for each constitution
B) Train a reward model for each constitution
C) Train gpt2 with the weighted reward models

Pragmatic steps to get there by mid December:
1. Train gpt2 on a reward model from huggingface
2. Use a constitution + gpt4 calls to train a reward model
3. Do this for each constitution
4. Train gpt2 according the mixed model

Run experiments
